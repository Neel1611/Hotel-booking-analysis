#### Business Problem: 
* In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a numbr of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer through business advice to address this problem.
* The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

#### Assumptions:
* No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used. (No Outlier)
* The information is still current and can be used to analyze hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner.
* There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique.
* The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.
* The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellation.
* Cancellation result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.
* Client make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations

#### Research Question:
* What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
* How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?

#### Hypothesis:
